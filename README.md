# Collabarray
#### *The Collaborative Networking Web Application*

### What is Collabarray?
--------------------------------
Collabarray is the networking web application that gives people the ability to collaborate with anyone in the world.  
Collabarray allows people to invest in projects that are still in their early stages.  
Unlike Kickstarter or LinkedIn, our product **creates a platform** for people to:  
* Create projects
* Find people to collaborate/network with
* Collaboratively get projects completed faster through teamwork.  

For these reasons we're more project focused, as supposed to job focused like LinkedIn.  
**We're essentially the _Kickstarter to Kickstarter_!**
  
### Who is it aimed at?
--------------------------------
This app is aimed at people that have ideas that require more than one person to complete.  
It is for the **creators**, **inventors**, **innovators** and **visionaries** that are *actually* motivated enough,  
to produce something to the public that could possibly make an impact.

  
### Technologies involved: 
--------------------------------
Basics: HTML, JavaScript, CSS  
Front-End: AngularJS, JQuery, ReactJS  
Back-End: NodeJS, ReactJS with Firebase
